One line of js to prevent moodle.u-paris.fr from downloading the files when you open them.

# Install
You can add the add-on on Firefox at this link https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/no_moodle_forcedownload/

# Why 
When you want to access the course, it downloads it automatically so you get duplicates of the documents on your computer.

You will save time and memory, this will make your student-at-Paris-Cit√© life easier !

# How
Some of the documents published on moodle while automatically be downloaded when you want to open them. This is because the link contains "forcedowload=1" parameter. This extension stupidly removes the parameter from the link.
